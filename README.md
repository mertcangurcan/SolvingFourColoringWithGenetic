# Solving Four-Coloring Problem with Generic Algorithm

In mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that, given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. 
There are many possible solutions available for this problem and the genetic algorithm is the one of them.
